# ASP.NET-Core-Web-API-Development
I developed a Web API using minimal APIs and implemented endpoint routing for handling requests. The project features middleware and endpoint filters to manage both common and specific request logic, with Dependency Injection applied to efficiently manage services and improve modularity.

#Focus:
Exploring the powerful capabilities of ASP.NET Core in developing Web APIs.
Understanding the ASP.NET Core hosting model and optimizing applications for performance.
Implementing Web API and mastering endpoint routing for seamless navigation.
Utilizing endpoint filters to execute common logic on specific endpoints efficiently.
Leveraging Dependency Injection (DI) to manage services and implement inversion of control.
